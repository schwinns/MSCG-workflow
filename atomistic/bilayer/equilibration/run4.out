NOTE: PME load balancing increased the non-bonded workload by more than 50%.
      For better performance, use (more) PME ranks (mdrun -npme),
      or if you are beyond the scaling limit, use fewer total ranks (or nodes).


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 30.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 8%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.4%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 15.038
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 60.2 %

NOTE: 60.2 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 33.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 8%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.5%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 16.170
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 60.7 %

NOTE: 60.7 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. Dispersion
  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.
