Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 33.9%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 9%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.1%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 12.266
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 59.3 %

NOTE: 59.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.

  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded

  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.
