Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: PME load balancing increased the non-bonded workload by more than 50%.
      For better performance, use (more) PME ranks (mdrun -npme),
      or if you are beyond the scaling limit, use fewer total ranks (or nodes).


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 41.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 9%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.8%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 11.245
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 56.2 %

NOTE: 56.2 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.087 nm, buffer size 0.087 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 52x52x80, spacing 0.114 0.114 0.119
This run will generate roughly 2 Mb of data
